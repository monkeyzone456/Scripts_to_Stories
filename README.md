# Scripts_to_Stories
Simple program for my dumbass future roomate that takes any text file and and splits it into 250 character sections for Snapchat Stories
but doing that by hand is too hard and programming would take 20 min. So i took 2 hours to create this whole ass github and top make is malleable and semi user friendly
but now you can do it for other movies too

--------------------------------------------
# Instructions
Just put whatever text file you got and it outputs it in the designated location (default is in Downloads)
